## Epigenomic Approaches

There are a variety of genomics techniques to start to profile the epigenome of cells. 

They fit a few different classes:

TF-bound/Histone Modifications: Cut and Run, Cut and Tag, ChIP-seq

Open Regions: ATAC-seq, MNase-seq and DNase-seq

Genome organization - Hi-C, HiCAR, Capture-C

---
## TF-bound/Histone Modifications

<div align="center">
<img src="imgs/41596_2020_373_Fig1_HTML.png" alt="setup" height="400" width="600">
</div>

[(Oker, et al, 2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-020-0373-x)

---
## TF-bound/Histone Modifications

* ChIP-seq
  - Strengths: Well established and validated across labs with robust antibody catalogs.
  - Weakness: High background, large cell input, potential artifacts from crosslinking/sonication, longest workflow.

* Cut & Run
  - Strengths: High signal-to-noise ratio, low input required (100 to 100,000 cells/nuclei), good resolution (20-80bp), can be used with crosslinking for weak/transient interactions, fewer reads (3-8 million).
  - Weakness: Sensitive to sample quality and nuclei preparation.

* Cut & Tag
	- Strengths: Highest signal-to-noise ratio, low input required (100 to 100,000 cells/nuclei), highest resolution (5-30bp), fewest reads (2 million).
	-	Weakness: The Tn5 bias toward open chromatin possible and GC, can't be used with crosslinking so can be tricky with transient TFs.


---
## Open Regions

<div align="center">
<img src="imgs/mnATAC.jpg" alt="offset" height="300" width="600">
</div>

* DNaseseq - Enzymatic digestion to extract signal from open chromatin around transcription factor binding sites.

* MNaseseq - Enzymatic digestion to extract signal repesenting nucleosome positioning.

* ATACseq - Uses transposases and offers a method to simultaneously extract signal from transcription factors binding sites and nucleosome positions from a single sample.

---
## ATACseq

ATACseq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing) uses a transposase to efficiently fragment accessible DNA prior to sequencing. The result provides a method to map the accessible/open chromatin genome wide.

In contrast to other techniques, ATACseq has several advantages including

* Low input material required (> 10,000 cells)
* Rapid experiment protocol (~ 4 hrs.)

## An overlaping workflow

Despite being different technologies that reveal differing biological phenomena the braod. strokes for analysis of all these techniques is the same:

1) Fastq QC
2) Alignment
3) Peak calling
4) Consensus Building
5) Counting
6) Differentials

We will review analysis of these data types with a unified approach, but highlight key differences that need to be considered between technologies as we go.

```{r, results='asis',include=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
if(params$isSlides == "yes"){

"    
  )
}else{
  cat("# Fastq QC

---
"    
  )
  
}

```

## The data

Our raw sequencing data will be in FASTQ format.

<div align="center">
<img src="imgs/fq1.png" alt="igv" height="200" width="600">
</div>

---
## The data

For your own data you will typically receive a fastq from the genomics group you are working with. 

For published data the fastq will be available on GEO/SRA or ENA. For example we will be working today with data from the Fuchs lab: [*The pioneer factor SOX9 competes for epigenetic factors to switch stem cell fates*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-023-01184-y)


You can download the fastq files (if you want) directly from ENA:

1) [Cut and Run](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA858098). 
2) [ATAC](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA858100). 


We will work through how to run these early steps, but we will also provide intermediate files once we have completed some of the heavy processing as some of these steps will take too long to run in these sessions. 

---
## Why QC?

At this time we will want to review the QC of our data. We can look for features like:

* Lack of library complexity
* Adapter contamination
* Poor sequencing quality


---
## How to QC

There are two main approaches:

1) Import the fastq into R and directly check metrics.

2) Use QC software like [fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) or [FastQC](https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC).

---
## Working with raw epigenomics data

Once we have downloaded the raw FASTQ data we can use the [ShortRead package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ShortRead.html) to review our sequence data quality.

We have more detailed course material on how to work with raw sequencing data in the [**FASTQ in Bioconductor** session.](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/presentations/slides/FastQInBioconductor.html#1)

First we load the [ShortRead library.](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ShortRead.html)


```{r shortreada,include=FALSE}
library(ShortRead)

```

```{r shortread, warning=F, message=F}
library(ShortRead)
```

---
## Working with raw data

First we will review the raw sequencing reads using functions in the [ShortRead package.](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ShortRead.html). 

We do not need to review all reads in the file to can gain an understanding of data quality. We can simply review a subsample of the reads and save ourselves some time and memory.

Note when we subsample we retrieve random reads from across the entire FASTQ file. This is important as FASTQ files are often ordered by their position on the sequencer.

---
## Reading a subsample

We can subsample from a FASTQ file using functions in **ShortRead** package.

Here we use the [**FastqSampler** and **yield** function](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/presentations/slides/FastQInBioconductor.html#41) to randomly sample a defined number of reads from a FASTQ file. Here we subsample 1 million reads. This should be enough to have an understanding of the quality of the data.

```{r, echo=F,eval=F}
fqSample <- FastqSampler("~/Downloads/SOX9CNR_D0_rep1_R1.fastq.gz",n=10^6)
fastq <- yield(fqSample)

writeFastq(fastq,file = "../data/SOX9CNR_D0_rep1_R1_subsample.fastq.gz",mode = "w")

```

```{r eval=T, echo=F}
fastq <- readFastq(dirPath = "data/sampled_ENCFF001NQP.fastq.gz")
```

```{r mycRep1Reads,echo=T,eval=F}
fqSample <- FastqSampler("~/Downloads/SRR20110418_1.fastq.gz",n=10^6)
fastq <- yield(fqSample)
```

---
## Working with raw ChIPseq data

The resulting object is a [ShortReadQ object](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/presentations/slides/FastQInBioconductor.html#10) showing information on the number of cycles, base pairs in reads, and number of reads in memory.

```{r mycRep1ReadsShortReadQ}
fastq
```

---

## Raw ChIPseq data QC

If we wished, we can assess information from the FASTQ file using [accessor functions.](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/presentations/slides/FastQInBioconductor.html#15)

* **sread()** - Retrieve sequence of reads.
* **quality()** - Retrieve quality of reads as ASCII scores.
* **id()** - Retrieve IDs of reads.

```{r mycRep1ReadsAccessor}
readSequences <- sread(fastq)
readQuality <- quality(fastq)
readIDs <- id(fastq)
readSequences
```

---
## Quality with raw ChIPseq data

We can check some simple quality metrics for our subsampled FASTQ data.

First, we can review the overall reads' quality scores.

We use the [**alphabetScore()** function with our read's qualitys](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/presentations/slides/FastQInBioconductor.html#28) to retrieve the sum quality for every read from our subsample.

```{r mycRep1ReadsQScores}
readQuality <- quality(fastq)
readQualities <- alphabetScore(readQuality)
readQualities[1:10]
```

---
## Quality with raw ChIPseq data

We can then produce a histogram of quality scores to get a better understanding of the distribution of scores.

```{r mycRep1ReadsQScoresPlot}
library(ggplot2)
toPlot <- data.frame(ReadQ=readQualities)
ggplot(toPlot,aes(x=ReadQ))+geom_histogram()+theme_minimal()
```


---

## Base frequency with raw ChIPseq data

We can review the occurrence of DNA bases within reads and well as the occurrence of DNA bases across sequencing cycles using the [**alphabetFrequency()**](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/presentations/slides/FastQInBioconductor.html#18) and [**alphabetByCycle()**](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/presentations/slides/FastQInBioconductor.html#30) functions respectively.

Here we check the overall frequency of **A, G, C, T and N (unknown bases)** in our sequence reads.

```{r mycRep1ReadsAlpFreq}
readSequences <- sread(fastq)
readSequences_AlpFreq <- alphabetFrequency(readSequences)
readSequences_AlpFreq[1:3,]
```


---
## Base frequency with raw ChIPseq data

Once we have the frequency of DNA bases in our sequence reads we can retrieve the sum across all reads.

```{r mycRep1ReadsAlpFreqSum}
summed__AlpFreq  <- colSums(readSequences_AlpFreq)
summed__AlpFreq[c("A","C","G","T","N")]
```

---

## Assess by cycle with raw ChIPseq data

We can review DNA base occurrence by cycle using the [**alphabetByCycle()** function.](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/presentations/slides/FastQInBioconductor.html#30)

```{r mycRep1ReadsAlpByCycle}
readSequences_AlpbyCycle <- alphabetByCycle(readSequences)
readSequences_AlpbyCycle[1:4,1:10]
```

---

## Assess by cycle with raw ChIPseq data

We often plot this to visualise the base occurrence over cycles to observe any bias.
First we arrange the base frequency into a data frame.

```{r mycRep1ReadsAlpByCyclePlot}
AFreq <- readSequences_AlpbyCycle["A",]
CFreq <- readSequences_AlpbyCycle["C",]
GFreq <- readSequences_AlpbyCycle["G",]
TFreq <- readSequences_AlpbyCycle["T",]
toPlot <- data.frame(Count=c(AFreq,CFreq,GFreq,TFreq),
                     Cycle=rep(1:40,4),
                     Base=rep(c("A","C","G","T"),each=40))

```

---

## Assess by cycle with raw ChIPseq data

Now we can plot the frequencies using ggplot2

```{r mycRep1ReadsAlpByCyclePlot2,cache=TRUE,eval=FALSE,dependson="mycRep1ReadsAlpByCyclePlot",fig.height=4,fig.width=8}

ggplot(toPlot, aes(y=Count,x=Cycle,colour=Base)) + geom_line() +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r mycRep1ReadsAlpByCyclePlot3}

ggplot(toPlot,aes(y=Count,x=Cycle,colour=Base)) + geom_line() + ylim(150000,400000) +
  theme_bw()
```

---
## Assess by cycle with raw ChIPseq data

We can also assess mean read quality over cycles. This will allow us to identify whether there are any issues with quality dropping off over time.

For this we use the [**as(*read_quality*,"matrix")**](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/presentations/slides/FastQInBioconductor.html#29) function first to translate our ASCII quality scores to numeric quality scores.

```{r mycRep1ReadsQByCycle,cache=TRUE,dependson="mycRep1ReadsAlpFreq"}
qualAsMatrix <- as(readQuality,"matrix")
qualAsMatrix[1:2,]
```

---

## Assess by cycle with raw ChIPseq data

We can now [visualise qualities across cycles using a boxplot.](https://rockefelleruniversity.github.io/Bioconductor_Introduction/exercises/answers/fastq_answers.html)

```{r mycRep1ReadsQByCyclePlot,cache=TRUE,dependson="mycRep1ReadsQByCycle",fig.width=8,fig.height=4}
boxplot(qualAsMatrix[1:1000,])
```

---

## Assess by cycle with raw ChIPseq data

In this case the distribution of reads quality scores and read qualities over time look okay. We will often want to access FASTQ samples together to see if any samples stick out by these metrics.

Here we observed a second population of low quality scores so will remove some reads with low quality scores and high unknown bases.

--- 
## Fastp

This is one of the most popular and respected QC tools around. 

It does what many of the others do, but it is VERY fast. There is a wrapper in R (developed by our team) so we can run it form R with ease: [Rfastp](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Rfastp.html)

There are many ways to customize including trimming options, barcodes and stringency. It will also handle the paired-end data simultaneously for us. 

--- 
## Rfastp

To run rfastp we simply provide our two fastq files (or just one if we are running single end). We will also provide a name for the filtered Fastq file which is output. 


```{R, eval=F}
library(Rfastp)

rfastp(read1="/Users/mattpaul/Downloads/SRR20110418_1.fastq.gz",
       read2 = "/Users/mattpaul/Downloads/SRR20110418_2.fastq.gz",
       outputFastq = "SOX9CNR_D0_rep1_filtered")
```

--- 
## Rfastp QC results

We can review the QC of our samples by checking out the the output *html* file. 

You can also review the samples computationally using the *.json* file. 


---
## What to check?

* Sequence over-representation (Kmer)
* Adapter content
* Duplicates

Whenever considering QC we rarely rule samples out at this early stage. But we keep an eye out for consistency between samples and if any sample looks bad across multiple metrics. 

--- 
## Rfastp options

We typically use the default settings, but there are lots of options to control rfastp. Specifically this could help more stringent filtering if you observe any QC problems i.e. minReadLength or qualityFilterPercent
